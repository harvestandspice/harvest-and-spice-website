## **5\) ABOUT / STORY (1 hour) — draft version**

**Paragraph 1 (origin):**  
Harvest & Spice began as a home-kitchen dream and grew into a Bay Area catering company built on nourishment, culture, and bold flavor. I started the business in 2023 without formal culinary training, learning by doing—cooking for community, refining recipes, and building a menu style that feels both vibrant and grounded.

**Paragraph 2 (style):**  
My food is Moroccan-inspired and California-fresh: seasonal vegetables, bright herbs, warming spices, and colorful spreads designed to feel abundant. I’m known for bold salads, mezze-style sides, and satisfying plant-forward mains that keep groups energized and happy.

**Paragraph 3 (why retreats/catering):**  
I love feeding groups—especially retreats—because food becomes part of the experience: it supports presence, connection, and care. Whether it’s a weekend retreat or a team offsite lunch, my goal is always the same: food that tastes incredible and leaves people feeling well.

**Paragraph 4 (close):**  
Harvest & Spice is Oakland-based and available for retreats, corporate catering, and private events across the Bay Area. Each menu is designed with intention, adapted for dietary needs, and delivered with professionalism and warmth
