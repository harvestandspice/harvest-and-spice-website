faq:
  title: Good to Know
  subtitle: A few things that help us serve you best
  items:
    - question: Lead Time
      answer: We prefer 2–4 weeks notice for most events, and 4–8 weeks for multi-day retreats. Last-minute requests (under 7 days) are difficult to accommodate.
    - question: Dietary Accommodations
      answer: We build vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options into every menu. For severe allergies, please note that we work in a shared kitchen and cannot guarantee zero cross-contamination.
    - question: Service Area
      answer: We're Oakland-based and serve the greater Bay Area—Berkeley, San Francisco, Marin, the Peninsula, and the Santa Cruz Mountains. Delivery fees may apply for extended areas.
    - question: Payment
      answer: A deposit is required to secure your date. Final payment is due before the event. We'll discuss details during the booking process.
