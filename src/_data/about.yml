story:
  title: The Beginning
  intro: Harvest & Spice began as a home-kitchen dream and grew into a Bay Area
    catering company built on nourishment, culture, and bold flavor.
  text: I started the business in 2023 without formal culinary training, learning
    by doing—cooking for community, refining recipes, and building a menu style
    that feels both vibrant and grounded.

  title: The Food
  intro: "Moroccan-inspired and California-fresh: seasonal vegetables, bright
    herbs, warming spices, and colorful spreads designed to feel abundant."
  text: I'm known for bold salads, mezze-style sides, and satisfying plant-forward
    mains that keep groups energized and happy. Every dish celebrates the
    connection between food, land, and the people we feed.

  title: Why Retreats
  intro: I love feeding groups—especially retreats—because food becomes part of
    the experience. It supports presence, connection, and care.
  text: Whether it's a weekend retreat or a team offsite lunch, my goal is always
    the same - food that tastes incredible and leaves people feeling well.
